# Introduction to the PowerModelsDistribution Data Models

In this notebook we introduce the engineering data model added to PowerModelsDistribution in version v0.9.0. We will give several examples of how to use this new data model directly, including new transformations that have become easier with its introduction, how to convert it to the the lower-level mathematical model that was previously the only user interface we offered, and how to get various types of results using this new model.

## Imports

All commands in this document with no package namespace specified are directly exported by PowerModelsDistribution or already available in Julia base. Any commands that are only avaiable via an external package will be specified by including by using `import`, which will require specifying the originating package before the command, _e.g._ `Ipopt.Optimizer` as you will see below.

## Parsing Data

Here we give the first example of how to parse data into the `ENGINEERING` data model structure, which is the default data structure type that the user will see without passing additional arguments, as we demonstrate later.

We start with a 3 bus unbalanced load case provided as a dss file in the `test` folder of the PowerModelsDistribution.jl repository

The next notable field is `"settings"`, which contains some important default/starting values for the distribution network

## Engineering Model Transformations

One of the power things about the engineering model is that data transformations are much more simple. Here we illustrate two examples that are currently included in PowerModelsDistribution, but writing your own data transformation functions will be trivial, as we will show.

__Note__: In v0.9, `apply_kron_reduction!` and `apply_phase_projection!` are applied by default, but can be disabled with the keyword arguments `kron_reduced=false` and `project_phases=false`, respectively in `parse_file` or `transform_data_model`.

First, there are several objects that have loss models by default when parsing from dss files, such as voltage sources, transformers, and switches. To remove these loss models, therefore making these components lossless, we can use the included `make_lossess!` function. Here we use a basic 2-winding wye-wye connected transformer case from `test` to illustrate this

## Mathematical Model

In this section we introduce the mathematical model, which was the previous user-facing model in PowerModelsDistribution, explain how conversions between the model happen in practice, and give an example of how to do this conversion manually

In practice, unless the user is interested, the conversion between the `ENGINEERING` and `MATHEMATICAL` models should be seemless and invisible to the user. By providing an `ENGINEERING` model to a `run_` command the `run_mc_model` command will know to convert the model to `MATHEMATICAL`, which will be used to the generate the JuMP model that will actually be optimized. Similarly, the solution generated by this optimization will be automatically converted back to the format of the `ENGINEERING` model.

Let's first take a look at how to convert to the `MATHEMATICAL` model

md"""
There are a couple of things to notice right away. First, the data model transform automatically converts the model to per-unit. Second, there are a lot of empty component sets, whereas in the `ENGINEERING` model, only component types that had components in them were listed. In the `MATHEMATICAL` model certain component dictionaries are always expected to exist, and the `eng2math` conversion functions will automatically populate these.

Next, there are a few unusal fields, such as `"settings"`, which previously didn't exist in the `MATHEMATICAL` model. This is used for the per-unit conversion specifically in PowerModelsDistribution. Also, is the `"map"` field, which is a `Vector` of Dictionaries that enable the conversion back to `ENGINEERING` from `MATHEMATICAL`. Without this it would be impossible to convert back, and in fact only the solution can be converted, because some properties are combined destructively during the conversion to the `MATHEMATICAL` model, and therefore cannot be reverse engineered. However, since the conversion to `MATHEMATICAL` is not in-place, you will always have a copy of `eng` alongside `math`.

Here is an example of one of the `"map"` entries

### Multinetworks

In this subsection we cover parsing into a multinetwork data structure, which is a structure that only exists in the `MATHEMATICAL` model

For those unfamiliar, the InfrastructureModels family of packages has a feature called multinetworks, which is useful for, among other things, running optimization problems on time series type problems. 

Multinetwork data structures are formatted like so

```julia
mn = Dict{String,Any}(
    "multinetwork" => true,
    "nw" => Dict{String,Any}(
        "1" => Dict{String,Any}(

            ...
        ),
        ...
    ),
    ...
)
