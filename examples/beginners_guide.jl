# Introduction to PowerModelsDistribution

This Notebook was designed for the following versions:

- `julia = "~1.6"`
- `PowerModelsDistribution = "~0.11"`
- `PowerModelsAnalytics = "~0.4.1"`

This notebook is a begginer's introduction to PowerModelsDistribution, an optimization-focused Julia library for quasi-steady state power distribution modeling, based on JuMP.jl, and part of the larger [InfrastructureModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/InfrastructureModels.jl) ecosystem, which notably includes:

- [PowerModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl) : Transmission (single-phase positive sequence power networks) optimization
- [GasModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasModels.jl) : Natural Gas pipeline optimization (includes Steady-state and Transient optimization)
- [WaterModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/WaterModels.jl) : Water network steady-state optimization

Details about PowerModelsDistribution.jl can be found in our [PSCC Conference Proceedings paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2020.106664).

# Importing Data

PMD supports two input formats, __OpenDSS__ and __JSON__. We strongly recommend OpenDSS for new users, as JSON is intended primarily for data models and results portability between colleagues working on the same problem, and OpenDSS is appropriate for specifying new networks.

Below is an example of an OpenDSS specification for a 3-phase, 3-bus balanced feeder:

```dss
$(dss)
```

Data is imported via the `parse_file` command, which we will use further down in the tutorial.

# Data Models

In PMD, there are two data models, an `ENGINEERING` data model, which is meant to be user facing, and to better reflect the engineering realities of the system, and a `MATHEMATICAL` data model, which reflect the mathematical representation of the system.

Data models are identified by a key in the data dictionary, `"data_model"`, whose values are `ENUM`s:

- $(ENGINEERING)
- $(MATHEMATICAL)

## ENGINEERING data model

Full specification of the `ENGINEERING` data model can be found in our [documentation](https://lanl-ansi.github.io/PowerModelsDistribution.jl/stable/eng-data-model/).

The engineering data model supports several broad categories of data:

- metadata
- node objects
- edge objects
- data objects

### Metadata

Metadata is mostly straight-forward, containing meta information about the feeder, on the parse, and what type of data model is currently being represented.

For `case3_balanced_eng` the following metadata fields are available:

- `name`
- `conductor_ids`
- `settings`
- `files`
- `conductors`
- `data_model`

md"""
`settings` and `data_model` are the most important metadata, required for solving any type of optimization problem.

`data_model` is self-explanatory, but `settings` requires some explanation. First and foremost, `settings` contains the information needed to calculate the voltage bases for all of the buses in the network. When parsing from a DSS file, these are not explicitly stated, and must be extrapolated from the voltage at the source, and the network must be walked-through, and in a case with transformers the new voltage base is adjusted on the other side of the transformer.

Inside `settings`, scalars can also be set, which might be valuable if, _e.g._, the power or voltage values are being scaled into inappropriate per-unit values.

Finally, `settings` also contains `base_frequency`, which by default is 60 Hz, but can be specified in OpenDSS, and is valuable to know if, for example, you are working with data from Europe, which might have a base frequency of 50 Hz.

### Distribution Assets

These consist of the actual physical assests in the distribution feeder, including the buses, which are the connective nodes on the network graph, lines, which are the fundamental edges, and others. In `case3_balanced_eng` there is the following asset types:

- `bus`
- `line`

### Enums

In the `ENGINEERING` data model we make heavy use of a Julia data structure called an `Enum`, or an Enumerated Type. This is a type whose values are enumerated, starting with 0. This has the benefit of being much more readable by the user.

If you are familiar with JuMP, you probably are already used to Enums `TerminationStatusCode` and `ResultStatusCode`, which we import explicitly from MathOptInterface and export, for easy access by the user when using `using PowerModelsDistribution`.

For example, instead of a switch `state` having the possible values 0 or 1, instead we created an enumerated type `SwitchState`, with values `OPEN` (0) and `CLOSED` (1).

We follow the convention that Enum values are all uppercase.

Enums can be cast into their integer values easily:
"""

Some common examples when you will typically see Enums include:

- `status`, on all components,
- `data_model`, at the root level,
- `dispatchable`, on things like switches, loads, and shunts, which indicate an ability to change their "state", like shedding the load, or opening or closing the switch
- `configuration`, which indicates the connection type, `WYE` or `DELTA`
- `model`, e.g., on loads, which can indicate the type of load, like constant `POWER`, `CURRENT`, `IMPEDANCE`, etc.

### Transformations

Transformations are one of the most powerfull aspects of using the engineering model, because items are more simple and self-contained rather than decomposed, editing before transformation into a mathematical model is significantly more straightforward.

The best example of this is Kron reduction, which is still done by default, where it would be too complicated at the mathematical level, requiring significant changes to the transformer models, for example.

Some simple examples that we commonly use involve settings better OPF bounds:
"""

Some other valuable transformations built into PMD are:

- `make_lossless` (will strip loss models on engineering assets that contain them, e.g., voltage sources or switches)
- `remove_all_bounds` (will remove all bounds, e.g., those parsed in from the raw dss file)

```julia
parse_file(case_file; data_model=MATHEMATICAL)
```

In some cases, the transformations are straight-forward, 1-to-1 type of conversions, where we convert to more optimization-friendly fields and units, like with lines -> branches, or loads -> loads.

But, some other components' transformations are less obvious, like voltage sources.

The reason for this is that some more complex objects can be decomposed into multiple mathematical objects.

### Componnent ID Format

In the engineering model, all component ids can be arbitrary strings, making it easier to navigate a feeder, but in the mathematical model we use only integers (Strings for dict keys, to maintain JSON compatibility, and Ints for ids within the data properties). For example:
""" |> Markdown.parse

### Additional Metadata

- `map`
- `bus_lookup`
- `basekv`
- `baseMVA`
- `is_projected`
- `per_unit`
- `is_kron_reduced`

Two particular items classified as metadata that are key for understanding how the data model maps between the engineering and mathematical models are `bus_lookup`, which maps bus names into their new integer ids, and `map`, which is an ordered list of actions that were taken to map engineering to mathematical model, so that we can map the solutions back up to the correct components in the engineering model.

### Asset Types

For mathematical models we initially adopted the PowerModels data model, which was originally designed based on the Matpower package. We try to largely maintain this parity with PowerModels even though it is no longer a dependency, which is why there there remains some inconsistency in property names compared to the engineering model. The current components in the math model are:

- `bus`
- `load`
- `shunt`
- `gen`
- `branch`
- `transformer`
- `switch`
- `storage`

The one notable divergence is the existance of `transformer`s. In distribution models, phase unbalanced transformers are much more complex than the typical two-winding Pi-branch model commonly utilized in transmission grids.

In the PMD math model, transformers are two-winding lossless transformers that can be either wye-wye or wye-delta connected.

Full optimization problems consist of a data model, a mathematical formulation, and a problem specification in which the variables, constraints and objectives are defined.

Additional details can be found in our documentation about the [mathematical problem specifications](https://lanl-ansi.github.io/PowerModelsDistribution.jl/stable/math-model/) and [formulations](https://lanl-ansi.github.io/PowerModelsDistribution.jl/stable/formulation-details/).

## Formulations

Formulations in PMD are represented by Julia Types, and have a clearly defined hierarchy, starting with our base abstact unbalanced (i.e., multiconductor) PowerModel: `AbstractUnbalancedPowerModel`.

Some useful abbreviations / acronyms in PowerModel and function names:

- `MC`/`_mc_` : multi-conductor, to differentiate from PowerModels.jl name, indicating applies to multiconductor / phase unbalanced / distribution problems.
- `U` : unbalanced
- `BF` : branch flow
- `ACP` : AC polar
- `ACR` : AC rectangular
- `IVR` : IV reectangular
- `LP` : linear program
- `SDP` : semi-definite program
- `SOC` : second-order cone

## Problem Specifications

Some additional helpful abbreviations for problem specifications:

- `mn` - Multinetwork, i.e., time series problem
- `uc` - unit-commitment, i.e., full load shed only, no partial shed

In PMD, there are two primary problem specifications,

- Optimal Power Flow (OPF) `solve_mc_opf`
  - There is a sub-problem for OPF called On-load Tap Changing (OLTC)
- Maximal Load Delivery (MLD) `solve_mc_mld`
  - There is also a "simple" version, but it will not work in conjunction with a switching optimization (`solve_mc_mld_simple`)
  - There is a caveat that the currently included MLD problem features continuous shedding of individual loads, which is not realistic for real-world distribution operations. While in transmission problems, one may assume some continuous shedding of loads, in real distribution grids, most loads can only be shed by using switches to isolate load blocks.

Recently, with the addition of idealized switches, we have also added a test version of a switching problem (OSW), which has variables for switch states of dispatchable switches, and an additional term in the objective to discourage state changes. This spec is experimental, but ongoing research in this area are expected to yield updates in this problem area.

We also have a debugging problem spec, `solve_mc_opf_pbs`, which will install slacks at every bus, which can be helpful in determining where the issue is in the network.

Power flow (`solve_mc_pf`) is also included, but if should be noted that this uses the same mechanism to solve as all of our optimization problems, and is therefore not efficient or quick, like a Newton-Raphson or Backwards/Forwards method for power flow solving might be.

Below is the primary example for the OPF problem:

# Example: Upgrading MLD to use Load Blocks

As mentioned in the section above on Problem Specifications, the MLD problem bundled in PMD represents all loads as individually sheddable, which is not accurate to distribution feeders, where it is unlikely that loads would be sheddable by themselves. Instead, usually loads are only sheddable as a whole block, by opening switches to isolate them. 

In this example I am going to get us closer to that more realistic problem by creating indicator variables for loads that apply to the whole load block, instead of variables for each load individually.

To achieve this, first we must be able to calculate the possible load blocks, which we can do with `identify_load_blocks`, which will return all sets of buses that can be isolated with switches...

To guarantee 0 or 1, which is the most realistic for distribution feeders, we should use the unrelaxed indicator variables, but this will require using a different solver that can support mixed-integer variables.

# Multinetwork Data and Problems

Next we will cover multinetwork problems, e.g. time series OPF.

PMD has a lot of tools for multinetwork problems, but really only one constraint that is inherently multinetwork, storage state.

Let's start with constructing a multinetwork data structure, and exploring it.

First, for multinetwork data to be created automatically, we need `time_series` data. If we have chosen one of the data sets above that contains `time_series`, this should have entries...

md"""
`time_series` is one of our "data" objects, in that it does not represent actual assets on the feeder, but represents information about one or more assets. `linecode`s are the most often encountered and most familiar data objects in feeder data.

Each `time_series` object will have "time", "values", and "replace", at a minimum, with optional "source_id", to help find the orginating object, and "offset", for which the intention if for it to add an offset to "time". "offset" is not yet supported, but datetime strings or floats in units of hours in "time" are supported.

"replace" indicates whether the values in "values" will replace the property they are assigned to, if `false`, values will be multiplied by the base value.

To apply a `time_series` object to a property, it must be specified within an asset's specification:
"""

If a input data set with timeseries data has been selected then one should find objects that have their own `"time_series"` dictionary, inside of which the keys are properties to be replaced, and values are references to root-level `time_series` objects.

OpenDSS has multiple ways to specify time series data, most usually through `LoadShapes`, which are specified on `Load` objects via the `daily` or `yearly` properties most often. 

By default PMD will parse the `daily` time series data, but you can specify this at parse:

```julia
parse_file(case_file; time_series="yearly")
```

If anything other than `"daily"` is chosen, it might be necessary to adjust `time_elapsed`, which will be discussed below.

If you have `time_series` data specified correctly, building a multinetwork is straightforward:

The reason for so much duplication of data is that the vision for multinetworks was never just for time series data, but that it could be used more generally in creative ways, like pairing two topologically different networks together with custom problem specifications. 

This use case means that things that you might expect to stay the same between time steps, like `conductor_ids`, `linecodes`, `settings`, and the overall topology, could be drastically different, and therefore should be replicated for each subnetwork.

This also explains the origin of the name "multinetwork", in case the standard use case made its name confusing.

As an interesting note, `make_multinetwork` will always return a multinetwork structure, even if there is no `time_series` data, with a single subnetwork with key `"0"`.

Transforming into the `MATHEMATICAL` data model from a multinetwork `ENGINEERING` data model is also the same as for single network data:

Some of the root-level keys will be slightly different, but otherwise you will see what you are already familiar with in the single network `MATHEMATICAL` data model.

It is also possible to transform directly into a multinetwork `MATHEMATICAL` data model from a single network `ENGINEERING` data model:

```julia
mn_math = transform_data_model(eng; multinetwork=true)
```

The one major caveat with these automatic generations of multinetwork data structures is that it **must** be performed before converting to the `MATHEMATICAL` data model. This is because, since we support replacing arbitrary fields with `time_series` data, it is impossible to work out the conversions within the `time_series` objects.

If you have a `MATHEMATICAL` data model and want to convert it to a multinetwork, this is supported, but you must already have a special construction of the `time_series` object that matches the format expected by InfrastructureModels, which has its own, more general, `make_multinetwork` function.

Multinetworks have two key helper functions:

- `sort_multinetwork!`
- `set_time_elapsed!`

The first accepts a Vector of `time` values, which it will use to manually re-sort the subnetworks, and the second accepts either a vector of time deltas or a single time delta, and replaces the `time_elapsed` property within all the subnetworks. 

`time_elapsed` a value in hours that indicates how long each time step duration is, which is needed for calculating storage losses.
