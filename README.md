ThreePhasePowerModels.jl is an extention package of PowerModels.jl for Steady-State Power Distribution Network Optimization.  It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform.  The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from the power network formulations (e.g. AC, linear-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...).
This enables the definition of a wide variety of power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.

**Core Problem Specifications**
* Power Flow (pf)
* Optimal Power Flow (opf), for the Bus Injection Model (BIM) as well as the Branch Flow Model (BFM)

**Core Network Formulations**
* AC (polar and rectangular coordinates)
* SDP BFM relaxation
* SOC BFM and BIM relaxation (W-space)
* Linear approximation (LinDist3Flow and simplified unbalanced DistFlow)

**Network Data Formats**
* Matlab ".m" files (extended for three-phase)
* OpenDSS ".dss" files

**Warning:** This package is under active development and may change drastically without warning.
