- Generators can now also be connected in both delta and wye.
- The delta/voltage-dependent loads in the ACP power models were refactored to be consistent with the new ones.
- The non-linear formulations now support matrix shunts.
- A current-voltage (IVR) formulation was added, and supports all features that ACP supports as well.
- Several power balance constraints now require NLconstraints because the load power/current can contain a NLexpression. This might be optimized further in the future if it leads to performance issues.

## v0.8.0

- Update solution building infrastructure (PowerModels #77) (breaking). The reported solution is now consistent with the variable space of the formulation.

- Simplified linear UBF formulations. LPLinUBFModel and LPdiagUBFModel are equivalent, and are replaced by LPUBFDiagModel. The more popular name 'LinDist3FlowModel' was added as an alias for LPUBFDiagModel.
- The linearization by Gan & Low is also equivalent to LPUBFDiagModel, though it has redundudant variables and equations. LPfullUBFModel is now implemented as an alias of LPUBFDiagModel, 'LPUBFFullModel'.
